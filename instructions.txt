Hi there!

We will attempt to use github for our calculations
since google drive on a unix system is not very
well supported.

Here's what we will be doing:

When you are done with a script you would like me to run, you 
will add the files you've changed to git, commit them, and push:
"git add <files>"
"git commit -m 'comments on what you have changed since your previous push in
quotes'"
"git push"
