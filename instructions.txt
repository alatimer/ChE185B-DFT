Hi there!

We will attempt to use github for our calculations
since google drive on a unix system is not very
well supported.

Here's what we will be doing:

When you are done with a script you would like me to run, you 
will add the files you've changed to git, commit them, and push:
"git add <files>"
"git commit -m 'comments on what you have changed since your previous push in
quotes'"
"git push"

getting ase+catmap to work:

Add the following to your bash_profile:

export PATH="/Users/allegralatimer/che185b-drm/ase/tools:$PATH"
export PYTHONPATH="/Users/allegralatimer/che185b-drm/ase:$PYTHONPATH"
export PYTHONPATH="/Users/allegralatimer/che185b-drm/catmap:$PYTHONPATH"
export PYTHONPATH="/Users/allegralatimer/che185b-drm/mpmath-all-0.19:$PYTHONPATH"

replace my name with yours; or if you installed somewhere else replace the whole root

type "source .bash_profile" into command line

type "ase -m test.py" into command line. If at the end it says, "OK" you are set up with ase!
If there is an error, you are not set up.
